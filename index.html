        <div><h1>Horticulture</h1>
        <p class="container">Horticulture is the science and art of cultivating fruits, vegetables, flowers, ornamental plants, and turfgrass. It is derived from the Latin words hortus (garden) and cultura (cultivation), literally meaning "garden cultivation."</p>

        <h2>Key Areas of Horticulture</h2>
    
<p class="container">The key areas of horticulture are defined by the plants cultivated and their end use. This includes **pomology** (fruit and nut cultivation), **olericulture** (vegetable production), and **viticulture** (grape growing). It also encompasses **floriculture** (growing flowers and ornamental plants) and **landscape horticulture**, which involves the design, installation, and maintenance of plants in the environment through nursery production, turf management, and arboriculture. Underpinning all these areas are the core sciences of plant propagation, growth, and postharvest management.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Horticulture</h2>
        <p class="container">Horticulture provides profound benefits that extend far beyond food production. It is vital for **human well-being**, offering nutritional health through fresh produce and mental health improvements by reducing stress and fostering a connection to nature. **Environmentally**, it enhances biodiversity, improves air and water quality, and cools urban areas. **Economically**, it supports millions of jobs in agriculture, landscaping, retail, and research, making it a cornerstone of a sustainable and healthy society.</p>

    <h2>Modern Techniques in Horticulture</h2>
        <p class="container">Modern horticulture increasingly relies on technology to enhance efficiency and sustainability. Key techniques include **controlled-environment agriculture** (CEA), such as greenhouses and vertical farms using precise LED lighting and hydroponics, and **precision agriculture**, which utilizes drones, sensors, and data analytics to optimize water and nutrient use. These advancements allow for higher yields, reduced environmental impact, and year-round production.</p>
